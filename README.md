## Description

Code for paper [Universal Barcode Detector via Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06281)

You can find some more details in readme_ru.md

### Disclaimer

- We will not provide training dataset as it has commercial value. But our future work includes creation of good synthetic dataset which we hope to release in the near future (**UPD: you can find it [here](https://github.com/abbyy/barcode_detection_benchmark)**)
- We are not going to support this code as we are working on much more convenient pytorch implementation, which, again, we hope to release soon (**UPD: you can find it [here](https://github.com/abbyy/barcode_detection_benchmark)**).
- The comments are in Russian
