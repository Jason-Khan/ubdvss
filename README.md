## Description

Code for paper [Universal Barcode Detector via Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06281)

### Disclaimer

- We will not provide training dataset as it has commercial value. But our future work includes creation of good synthetic dataset which we hope to release in the near future
- We are not going to support this code as we are working on much more convenient pytorch implementation, which, again, we hope to release soon.
- The comments are in Russian
